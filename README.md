# Publishing a GitHub release &amp; triggering the GitHub workflow

Workflow triggers are events that cause a workflow to run. These events can be:

* Events that occur in your workflowâ€™s repository
* Events that occur outside of GitHub and trigger a repository_dispatch event on GitHub
* Scheduled times
* Manual
  
Generally, when you are working on a project where you need to maintain different environments like staging, development, and production you need to define different strategies to trigger a workflow.
